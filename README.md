# Research Adventures prototype

A demo version of the Reeearch Adventures series of information and digital literacy training resources.

This was created using [Raconteur and the handy scaffolding tool developed by Bruno Dias](https://github.com/sequitur/raconteur).

## About this project

Research Adventures is a series of interactive learning resources developed by [Artefacto](http://artefacto.org.uk/). This is the beta version and is very much a work in progress.


## To Do

Research Adventure no.1 is an interactive-fiction style, text-based adventure that helps users gain information literacy skills while choosing their own research path and gaining rewards as they go.

- Finish story pathways and complete branching
- Add learning outcomes
- Create base adventure template
- Add short demo version
- Lots of other things

## File Structure

There's lots of scaffold structure here for development, the game compiles into the build/game directory (handily).  For development, check out the [Raconteur](http://github.com/sequitur/raconteur/) repository.

## Usage

This scaffold comes prepped for usage with Gulp as a build system, Less for CSS preprocessing, Browserify for bundling JavaScript, and CoffeeScript as a JS transpiler.
